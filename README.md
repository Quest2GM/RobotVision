# RobotVision

![](Robot_Vision_logo.gif)

The goal of RobotVision is to be able to simulate the control of a robot. The app will be a combination of many aspects of control theory, filtering and Bayesian techniques and will feature a supposed 'TurtleBot' trying to navigate through obstacles in a stable and efficient manner. The experience in building this app will have great implications on getting a strong grasp of very powerful modern robotic controllers, and may give rise to new discoveries.

The project will be prototyped in Python and will be later converted to C++. For this reason, the prototype will be written from scratch with minimal use of complex libraries. It is also planned to first start with a 2D simualtor, and later on move to 3D through the help of OpenGL.
